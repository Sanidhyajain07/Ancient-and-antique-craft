Sculpting human forms and showing daily life with majestic wood carvings was also the local livelihood of rural villagers. With modern trends coming to the fore, people are showing more enthusiasm for ethnic works with a touch of modernity. The range includes utility items like incense holders, boxes, jewelry boxes, card holders and also ethnic statues as well as figurines. Authentic wood work is also an art projecting furniture works in Shesham wood.<br>
